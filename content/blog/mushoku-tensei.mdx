# Mushoku Tensei: Why It’s My Favourite Anime of All Time

Okay, so I know a lot of people have opinions about **Mushoku Tensei**. And yeah, fair enough. The MC, Rudeus? He’s a total creep in the beginning, and honestly, it’s fucking cringe. Plus, the show takes its sweet time getting going sometimes. You’re waiting for the big stuff to happen, and it’s just… more talking and learning.

So why am I giving this a solid **9 out of 10**? Because here’s the wild thing: all those “flaws” everyone talks about? They’re actually what makes this show so good.

## Rudeus’s Growth Feels Earned

Think about Rudeus. He was a total loser in his old life, and he comes back as a baby with all that baggage. His perverted side isn’t just there for cheap laughs (even if it sometimes feels like it). It’s because he’s a messed-up dude trying to figure things out. If he just magically became a perfect hero right away, it would be so boring. We’d be like, “Okay, cool, another OP guy.” But because he starts from such a cringey place, every time he does something good, it feels like a **HUGE deal**. You’re genuinely rooting for him, even when he messes up. It’s like watching your friend slowly grow up, stop being annoying, and become someone you can respect.

## Pacing That Lets the World Breathe

Yeah, it’s slow at times, especially in Season 1. But honestly, that’s what makes the world feel so lived-in. You get to see Rudeus learn basic magic, get taught how to read, just exist in this new world. Most isekai dump the hero in and they’re instantly amazing. Here, you see him struggle, fail, and slowly get stronger. So when the big fights or important moments finally happen, you actually care. You’ve spent so much time with him and in this world that it matters. It’s not just random explosions; it’s the payoff for everything he worked for.

## Fan Service as Character Development

Even the fan service stuff, which can be a lot early on, kind of makes sense when you think about it. It’s part of the whole messed-up package of who Rudeus was and is. And as he grows up and gets his priorities straight, you see less of it—showing his evolution rather than just titillation for the sake of it. It’s not always handled perfectly, but it’s part of his messy journey.

Mushoku Tensei isn’t afraid to show you a hero who’s a total mess, makes mistakes, and takes forever to get his act together. But that’s exactly why it’s so good. It’s not just another power fantasy. It’s about a guy actually trying to be a better person, step by painful step. It’s not always easy to watch, but when he finally does something right—or when you see how much he’s grown—it hits different.

If you haven’t watched it yet, what are you waiting for? Season 3 is right around the corner and, having read the light novels, you’re in for a treat :p
