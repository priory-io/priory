**TLDR**: NextJS is the first framework that’s made me actually enjoy building web stuff. Here’s why.

I’ve spent the last year neck-deep in NextJS, and honestly? I’m not looking back. I used to think React was fine, but NextJS is React with all the annoying bits sanded off and a bunch of actually useful features glued on. If you’re still stuck in create-react-app hell, I’m sorry for your loss.

## AnonHost: My Favorite Side Project

Let’s talk about [AnonHost](https://github.com/keircn/anonhost), because it’s the project that made me realize how much NextJS just *gets it*. AnonHost is a free, open-source file storage solution. It’s got code snippets, a URL shortener, and a UI that doesn’t make me want to gouge my eyes out. All of that, built with NextJS.

### Here’s the thing:

File uploads? Dead simple with API routes.
SSR for the landing page? One line, done.
Need a custom API for the URL shortener? No need to spin up a separate backend, just add a file in `/api`.

Example:
Want to add a new API endpoint for shortening URLs?
Just do this:

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { url } = await req.json();
  const short = generateShortUrl(url);
  await saveToDb(short, url);
  return NextResponse.json({ short });
}
```

No Express boilerplate, no CORS headaches, no “wait, do I need to restart the server?” nonsense. It just works.

## Why NextJS Doesn’t Suck  

- **File-based routing**: I don’t want to write a router config. I want to drop a file in `/app/...` and have it show up. NextJS gets that.
- **API routes**: I can write backend logic right next to my frontend. No more context switching.
- **Built-in SSR/SSG**: I can choose per-page if I want static, server, or client rendering. No more “oh, I guess I need x for this.”
- **TypeScript support**: Out of the box. No config hell.
- **Deployment**: While I do love a bit of self-hosting, Vercel does have a generous free tier and they make deploying NextJS feel so easy it's unsettling.

## Just kidding

NextJS is completely perfect with ZERO flaws!
