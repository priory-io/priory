    title: "The Art of Code Review in Modern Development",
    excerpt:
      "Code review is more than just catching bugs. Learn how to provide meaningful feedback that improves code quality and helps teams grow together.",
    content: `# The Art of Code Review in Modern Development

Code review has evolved from a simple quality gate to a crucial practice for team learning, knowledge sharing, and maintaining code standards. Done well, it creates better software and stronger teams.

## Why Code Review Matters

Code review serves multiple purposes beyond finding bugs:

- **Knowledge Transfer**: Sharing domain knowledge across the team
- **Skill Development**: Learning from each other's approaches
- **Code Consistency**: Maintaining team standards and patterns
- **Bug Prevention**: Catching issues before they reach production

## Best Practices for Reviewers

### Be Constructive
Focus on the code, not the person. Phrase feedback as questions or suggestions rather than commands.

**Good**: "What do you think about extracting this logic into a separate function?"
**Better**: "Consider extracting this logic for better readability."

### Explain the Why
Don't just point out what's wrongâ€”explain why it matters and suggest alternatives.

### Review Thoroughly but Efficiently
Take time to understand the context, but don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

## Best Practices for Authors

### Write Clear Descriptions
Help reviewers understand what you're trying to achieve and why you made certain decisions.

### Keep Changes Focused
Smaller, focused pull requests are easier to review and less likely to introduce bugs.

### Respond Constructively
View feedback as an opportunity to learn and improve, not as criticism.

## Building a Review Culture

The best teams treat code review as a collaborative learning experience. Foster an environment where:

- Questions are welcomed
- Different approaches are discussed
- Learning is prioritized over ego
- Feedback is specific and actionable

Remember: we're all here to build great software together.`,

    excerpt:
      "Discover advanced TypeScript patterns that make React development more robust, maintainable, and enjoyable. From generic components to utility types.",
    content: `# TypeScript Patterns for Better React Development

TypeScript and React are a powerful combination, but mastering their integration requires understanding some key patterns. Let's explore techniques that will make your React code more type-safe and maintainable.

## Generic Components

Generic components are incredibly powerful for creating reusable UI elements:

\`\`\`typescript
interface SelectProps<T> {
  items: T[];
  value: T;
  onChange: (value: T) => void;
  renderItem: (item: T) => React.ReactNode;
}

function Select<T>({ items, value, onChange, renderItem }: SelectProps<T>) {
  return (
    <select onChange={(e) => onChange(items[e.target.selectedIndex])}>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <option key={index} value={index}>
          {renderItem(item)}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Utility Types for Props

Create flexible prop interfaces using TypeScript's utility types:

\`\`\`typescript
type ButtonVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';

interface BaseButtonProps {
  variant: ButtonVariant;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

type ButtonProps = BaseButtonProps & 
  (
    | { href: string; onClick?: never }
    | { href?: never; onClick: () => void }
  );
\`\`\`

## Discriminated Unions for State

Model complex state with discriminated unions:

\`\`\`typescript
type AsyncState<T> = 
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success'; data: T }
  | { status: 'error'; error: string };

function DataComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState<AsyncState<User>>({ status: 'idle' });
  
  switch (state.status) {
    case 'loading':
      return <LoadingSpinner />;
    case 'success':
      return <UserProfile user={state.data} />;
    case 'error':
      return <ErrorMessage error={state.error} />;
    default:
      return <LoadDataButton onClick={loadData} />;
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Conditional Props

Create components with conditional props based on other prop values:

\`\`\`typescript
type ConditionalProps<T> = T extends { multiselect: true }
  ? { value: string[]; onChange: (value: string[]) => void }
  : { value: string; onChange: (value: string) => void };

type InputProps<T = {}> = T & ConditionalProps<T> & {
  multiselect?: boolean;
};
\`\`\`

These patterns help create components that are both flexible and type-safe, making your development experience smoother and your code more maintainable.`,

    excerpt:
      "Learn practical strategies for improving web performance using the latest browser APIs, optimization techniques, and monitoring tools.",
    content: `# Optimizing Web Performance with Modern Techniques

Web performance directly impacts user experience, conversion rates, and SEO rankings. Let's explore modern techniques for building fast, responsive web applications.

## Core Web Vitals

Focus on the metrics that matter most:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
Optimize your largest content element to load within 2.5 seconds:

- Use optimized images (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement critical resource hints
- Optimize server response times

### First Input Delay (FID)
Keep your main thread responsive:

- Break up long tasks with scheduling
- Use web workers for heavy computations
- Optimize JavaScript execution

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
Prevent unexpected layout shifts:

- Set explicit dimensions for images and videos
- Reserve space for dynamic content
- Use CSS transforms instead of layout-changing properties

## Image Optimization

Modern image optimization goes beyond compression:

\`\`\`html
<picture>
  <source srcset="hero.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="hero.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="hero.jpg" alt="Hero image" loading="lazy">
</picture>
\`\`\`

## JavaScript Optimization

### Code Splitting
Split your JavaScript bundles for faster initial loads:

\`\`\`typescript
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### Tree Shaking
Eliminate dead code from your bundles by using ES modules and tools like Webpack or Vite.

## Resource Loading

### Preloading Critical Resources
\`\`\`html
<link rel="preload" href="/critical.css" as="style">
<link rel="preload" href="/hero.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
\`\`\`

### Service Workers
Cache resources and provide offline functionality:

\`\`\`typescript
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.destination === 'image') {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request).then(response => 
        response || fetch(event.request)
      )
    );
  }
});
\`\`\`

## Monitoring and Measurement

Use tools like:
- Lighthouse for comprehensive audits
- WebPageTest for detailed performance analysis
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) for production insights

Remember: measure first, optimize second. Focus on the biggest impact improvements for your specific use case.`,
